= ValidatesWithBlock

A plugin that allows for dynamic, more readable block-driven validation for
ActiveRecord models.

== Installing as a plugin

EDGE Rails has support for plugin installation from Git, so if you're using
EDGE Rails you can install with:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/fhwang/validates_with_block.git

We're maintaining an SVN clone of the plugin for those of you who aren't on
EDGE Rails yet:

  ./script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/nycrb/validates_with_block

== Using ValidatesWithBlock

Basically this plugin is meant to help you make your models a little cleaner if 
you've got a lot of validations. Instead of:

  validates_presence_of   :login, :message => 'Please enter a login.'
  validates_uniqueness_of :login, :case_sensitive => false
  validates_format_of     :login, :with => /\A\w*\Z/
  validates_length_of     :login, :within => 4..15
  
You can write:

  validates_login do |login|
    login.present   :message => 'Please enter a login.'
    login.unique    :case_sensitive => false
    login.formatted :with => /\A\w*\Z/
    login.length    :within => 4..15
  end
                               
The methods map to validation methods as follows:

  login.confirmed          => validates_confirmation_of
  login.formatted          => validates_format_of
  login.formatted_as_email => validates_email_format_of
  login.length             => validates_length_of
  login.present            => validates_presence_of
  login.unique             => validates_uniqueness_of

== formatted_as_email

You may have noticed the inclusion of validates_email_format_of; that's not a 
standard ActiveRecord validation. It comes from the very useful 
validates_email_format_of plugin, which is available at 
http://code.dunae.ca/validates_email_format_of.html . Obviously 
formatted_as_email won't work if you haven't installed this plugin.
